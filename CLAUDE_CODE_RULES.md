# Claude Code Rules

This project uses Claude for AI-assisted code generation. Follow these guidelines when generating or editing code:

- Prefer clear, self-documenting names.
- Include inline comments for complex logic.
- Use TypeScript for new code unless otherwise required.
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility.
- Write tests alongside new features.
- Avoid introducing external dependencies without discussion.
